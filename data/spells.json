At the end of her turn each round, the wind blows her 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM’s option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or suffering physical damage from being buffeted about. You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You train a mount to air walk with the Handle Animal skill (air walking counts as an unusual task; see page 68)."

An animal’s loyalty, once gained, is natural (not magical) and lasting. You can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks include attacking, coming when called, guarding a place, and protecting a character. They cannot be complex (complex tricks, such as accepting a rider, require the Handle Animal skill; see page 68). At any one time, you can have only a certain number of animals befriended to you. At most, you can have animal friends whose Hit Dice total no more than twice your caster level (though the demands of adventuring generally restrict a character to half that number). For example, a 3rd- level druid could use this spell to win the friendship of an animal of 6 HD or less, but an adventuring druid would only be able to maintain an animal of 3 HD as a friend. An adventuring 5th-level ranger would generally be able to maintain animal friends whose HD totaled 2 or less. You may dismiss animal friends to enable you to befriend new ones.

Size: The creature’s size increases one step. This increase reduces its AC (according to the new size), reduces its attack bonus (according to the new size), affects its ability to grapple (page 137), and so on.

You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain or mouth of a nearby river). The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. Note that unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored. The intended recipient of a message gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it’s in a language she doesn’t know, for example).

Regardless of the type of undead, you can’t create more HD of undead than you have caster levels with a single casting of animate dead. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones (so purple worm skeletons are not allowed). If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. See the Monster Manual for details. Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The creature must have a true anatomy (so gelatinous cube zombies are not allowed). The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. See the Monster Manual. Material Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells."

One command can be given each round as a standard action. The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll. The rope has a range increment of 10 feet. A typical rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and can be burst with a Strength check (DC 23). The rope does not deal damage of any type, but it can be used as a trip line or to entangle a single opponent who fails a Reflex saving throw. An entangled creature suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls and a –4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the rope can anchor itself to an immobile object, the entangled creature cannot move. Otherwise, it can move at half speed but can’t run or charge. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with an Escape Artist check (DC 20). The rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are not magical.

Area: 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you Duration: 10 minutes/level (D) Saving Throw: None Spell Resistance: See text An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when it leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell’s duration. Golems and other magical constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an antimagic area (though the antimagic area suppresses their supernatural, spell-like, and spell abilities normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below. Summoned or conjured creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that’s maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a conjured creature who has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature’s SR to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by the antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) Normal creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Undead and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. Note: Should you be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of your person that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.

If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible (though not necessarily understandable). See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows their users to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If cast on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the mark to fade in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting Drawmij’s instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details)."

    "description": "Freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body into another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other creatures with you, provided the creatures are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self into the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. You then leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. When on the Astral Plane or another plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and materially. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to their physical bodies. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you). Material Components: A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected."

    "description": "This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity at the cost of 500 experience points in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Naturally, many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine if the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf. Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected: Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points. Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to unwillingly or unwittingly committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Note: A paladin who willingly and deliberately commits an evil act can never regain her paladinhood. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost his ability to cast spells because he incurred the anger of his deity may regain his spell powers by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders (or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally). Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (NPCs). This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively. Material Component: Burning incense. Focus: In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp. XP Cost: When cast for the benefit of creatures whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost to you is 500 XP per casting (see above)."

For example, if a party is considering destroying a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury might determine whether it’s a good idea. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that the question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: “Weal” (if the action will probably bring good results). “Woe” (for bad results). “Weal and woe” (for both). “Nothing” (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad results). If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it resulted from a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the augury. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first augury. Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value."

For each such object or substance, you gain +1 on your caster level check to overcome the target’s SR (if any) and +2 on the saving throw DC.

    "description": "A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target only gets an initial saving throw if its HD is equal to at least half your caster level. You may have up to six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of the spell increases by +1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your effective level increases by a number equal to one-third that assistant’s level (provided the target is appropriate for the spell). Since the assistants’ spells are cast simply to improve the caster level of the caster of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against them are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding durations are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire (but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass). The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, or hit points don’t qualify. For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by +2. The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. Duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for up to one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1. Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per caster level. Reduce save DC by 2. Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The spell is permanent. Reduce save DC by 3. Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent (your choice). The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem or similar object or jar. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce save DC by 4. In the case of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect (the durations overlap). If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell’s duration (even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw). If the creature succeeds at this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken. Components: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding. These include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and so on. In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured."

    "description": "Like a blink dog, you “blink” back and forth between the Material and the Ethereal planes. You look as though you’re winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random. Blinking has several effects: Physical attacks suffer a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t help (since the blinker is ethereal and not merely invisible). If the attack is capable of striking ethereal or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for one-half concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. If the attacker can both see and strike ethereal creatures, he suffers no penalty. Likewise, your own attacks suffer a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Likewise, your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (+2 attack), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You suffer only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there’s a 50% chance that you become material, with regrettable consequences (see below). You can move only at three-quarters speed: Movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. Note: An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down (albeit at half normal speed). As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as normally material. An ethereal creature who becomes material while in a material object is shunted off to the nearest open space and takes 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled."

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone. For each such effect, you make a check of 1d20 + caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For cursed magic items, the DC is 25. If the spell is one that, as a special property, cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it. If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item but merely frees the victim from the item’s effects, leaving the item cursed. For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user. Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item (and negates the alignment change), but the item’s curse is intact and affects the next person to pick up the item (even if it’s the break enchantment recipient)."

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it’s holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes very chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage (this is also the effect on the last round of the spell’s duration). During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown below: Metal Round Temperature Damage 1 Cold None 2 Icy 1d4 points 3–5 Freezing 2d4 points 6 Icy 1d4 points 7 Cold None Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the creature plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no chill damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant. Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal."

If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell’s effect. Lead sheeting or magical protection (such as antimagic field, mind blank, or nondetection) blocks the spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked.

The original’s physical remains, should they still exist, become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original has reached the end of its natural life span (died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails. To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) taken from the original’s living body, with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (such as by the gentle repose spell). Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When the clone is completed, if the original is dead, the original’s soul enters the clone. The clone has the personality, memories, skills, and levels the original had at the time the piece of flesh was taken. However, the replacement must be at least one level lower than the original was at the time of death. If the original was 1st level, the clone’s Constitution score drops by 1; if this would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is at the level at which the original died. The spell duplicates only the original’s body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting creature is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not somehow preserved.

Living creatures above 6 HD, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD who make their saving throws, take 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the cloud. Holding one’s breath doesn’t help. Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. (Figure out the cloud’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.)

Animated plants gain humanlike senses. The plants’ AC, speed, attacks, and special abilities vary with their size and form, as described for animated objects in the Monster Manual. You can animate two trees, four shrubs, or eight vines. All plants to be affected must be within 60 feet of each other. You can animate different types of plants if desired (for example, one tree and four vines or a tree and two shrubs). Creatures who have the plants in their possession can prevent the effect with Will saves or spell resistance. The effect lasts 1 hour per caster level. Entangle: You imbue all plants within range with semimobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This duplicates the effect of an entangle spell.

The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet per caster level. The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell. The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water (or similar liquid) to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land near the raised water, the water can spill over onto dry land. For either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension. Arcane Material Component: A drop of water (to raise water) or a pinch of dust (to lower water)."

Season Possible Weather Spring: Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather Summer: Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm Autumn: Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet Winter: Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw Late winter: Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area) You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously— fog and strong wind, for example. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the effect to any circular area less than your full range (for example, a 20-foot-diameter tornado centered 100 feet away). Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell’s area: A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions. An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center. A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other. Wind Force: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. (The effects of wind force are described in detail in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.) Each round, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect. Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage. A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder. A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees."

This carpetlike mass swarms in a square 20 feet on a side. Upon your command, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round toward any prey within 100 feet, moving in the direction you command. Each vermin in the creeping doom effect automatically bites a creature for 1 point of damage and then dies. Each creature takes enough damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Thus, a total of 1,000 points of damage can be inflicted on those in the creeping doom’s effect. These attacks are nonmagical attacks, so creatures with damage reduction, for example, are safe. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, damage is distributed among the survivors equally. If creeping doom travels more than 100 feet away from you, it loses 50 of its number for each additional 10 feet it travels. For example, at 120 feet, its numbers have shrunk by 100. There are a number of ways to thwart or destroy the creatures forming the swarm. Anything that would deter or destroy normal insects is effective against these insects."

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells. Dispel magic affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells. Note: The effects of spells with instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. Thus, you can’t use dispel magic to repair fire damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. (The magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.) You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the spell. You make a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the spell’s caster level. For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a hasted, mage armored, strengthened drow. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20+5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor, and bull’s strength effects. If she succeeds at a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow’s SR doesn’t help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect. If the spellcaster targets an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), she makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. Remember that a magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Area Dispel: The spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius. For each creature who is the target of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel so far as that target is concerned) or fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected. For each object that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by area dispels. For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the dispel magic’s area, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel, you make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the area of the dispel magic. If an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell, such as a monster summoned by monster summoning, is in the area, you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed at dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: The spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 152). Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work. You must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell."

    "description": "Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. For example, suppose the question is “Will we do well if we venture into the ruined temple of Erythnul?” The DM knows that a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a +1 shield lurks near the entrance but estimates that your party could beat the troll after a hard fight. Therefore the divination response might be: “Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. Note that if your party doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.) The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination and yield the same answer each time. Material Component: Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp."

An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris. Cliffs: They crumble, causing a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path sustains 8d6 points of damage (Reflex half DC 15). Open Ground: All creatures standing in the area must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or fall down. Fissures open in the ground, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex save DC 20 to avoid the fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within. Structure: Most structures standing on open ground collapse, dealing 8d6 points of damage to those caught within or beneath the rubble (Reflex half DC 15). River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Creatures must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud."

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process. However, it is constrained without harm by stronger materials—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth. Magical properties are not increased by this spell—an enlarged +1 sword is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant- sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, and so on. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizable, longer rope, and so on. A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and base attack bonus do not change, but Strength increases along with size. For every 20% of enlargement, the creature gains a +1 enlargement bonus to Strength.

This check is based on the character with the highest Charisma and has a +2 bonus for each other jeerer who can make a Charisma check of 10 or higher. The heckling ends the spell if it beats your opposed Charisma check. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If any member of the audience is attacked (or subjected to an overtly hostile act), the spell ends and the audience becomes immediately unfriendly toward you (or hostile, for audience members with 4 or more HD and Wisdom 16 or higher)."

The four versions of the spell are as follows: Charm: Equivalent to the charm monster spell, except that the saving throw is based on spell level 6. Fear: The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. Once it stops fleeing, the creature refuses to face you for 10 minutes per your caster level. If subsequently confronted by you, it either cowers or bolts for the nearest cover (50% chance of either). This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind-affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save. Sicken: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject’s body. An affected creature’s speed is reduced by half, it loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and it suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls. The creature remains stricken for 10 minutes per your caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. This is a necromancy effect; it can be negated by a Fortitude save. Sleep: The subject falls asleep. The creature sleeps for your caster level x 10 minutes but can be slapped awake. This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind- affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save. Note: Each round, a gaze attack automatically works against one creature within range that is looking at (attacking or interacting with) the gazing creature. Creatures can avert their eyes, which grants them a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants the gazer one-half concealment (20% miss chance) relative to them.

Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.

A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d8), divided up among the acorns as you wish. A 20th-level druid could create one 20d8 missile, two 10d8 missiles, one 11d8 and three 3d8 missiles, or any other combination of d8s totaling up to four acorns and 20d8 points of damage. The acorns deal 1 point of splash damage per die and ignite any combustible materials within 10 feet. If a creature within the burst area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage; a creature struck directly always sustains full damage (no saving throw). Holly Berry Bombs: You turn up to eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, being too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). They burst into flame if you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to creatures and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.

This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire- based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat and giving light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)—blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows. Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

When someone other than you opens the item, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center.

The fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A knock spell does not affect a fire trap in any way, because knock only opens things and the fire trap in no way prevents one from opening the trapped item. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam. As the caster, you can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. “Attuning” to an individual usually involves a password that you can share with friends. Note: Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the trap and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid’s fire trap or DC 29 for the arcane version). Material Components: A half-pound of gold dust (cost 25 gp) sprinkled on the warded object.

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside or can pass through the slits in the barred cage. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force spell, the forcecage resists dispel magic, but it is vulnerable to a disintegrate spell, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. Barred Cage: The barred cage is a 20-foot cube with bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars. The bands are a half- inch wide, with half-inch gaps between the bars. Windowless Cell: The cell is a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides. Material Component: The spell needs no material component at the time of casting, but you must have 1,500 gp worth of ruby dust to prepare the spell. Upon completing preparations, you toss the dust into the air and it disappears, leaving only the verbal and somatic components to be provided at the time of casting."

Once the spell is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself—duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on—and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and to Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the object of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and it can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the spell subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Arcane Material Component: A hummingbird’s feather."

    "description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and the plane desired, allowing travel between the planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or type of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window into the plane you named, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. The gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to another plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, gate functions much like the plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Note that deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. A clever caster could fill a hallway with the gate’s opening in order to absorb almost any attack or force coming at her by gating it to the target plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level) and must concentrate on doing so or sever the interplanar connection. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or type of being as you cast the spell, you may cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. If you choose to call a type of being instead of a known individual—for instance, a barbazu or a ghaele eladrin— you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. If several creatures, you can call and control them as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more than twice your caster level in HD can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. These fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from the called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward. In general, a gift of 100 gp per HD of the called creature per day of service is reasonable. (Unfortunately, some creatures want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which may involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon."

Once crippled, the subject is effectively disabled (as if he had 0 hit points) and can’t choose to take strenuous actions.

A glyph can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature violating the warded area without speaking a pass phrase (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or species (such as “drow” or “aberration”). Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection can fool a glyph. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 13). Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored). The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to you depend on your deity. He or she might also make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules. Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of the intruder (maximum 5d8). This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Those affected can make Reflex saves to take half damage. Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of up to 3rd level that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. All saving throws operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the glyph. Material Component: You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp."

Those that successfully save can move at half speed across the surface. However, those that remain in the area must each make a new saving throw every round to avoid falling and to be able to move. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item—a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area: Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have full concealment (50% miss chance; the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Spell resistance: No. Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Spell resistance: No. Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Spell resistance: Yes. Confusion: Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the exact opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment (mind-affecting) effect. Spell resistance: Yes. Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a glamer to appear as if it were a plain wall. Spell resistance: No. In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects: Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Spell resistance: No. A magic mouth in two places. Spell resistance: No. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Spell resistance: Yes. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Spell resistance: Yes. A suggestion in one place. You select an area up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Spell resistance: Yes. The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful Mordenkainen’s disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards effect. Material Components: Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of umber hulk blood. Focus: A small silver rod."

(Note: This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.) Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature. Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallowed again. Spell effects that may be tied to a hallow site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, negative energy protection, protection from elements, remove fear, resist elements, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one hallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. Hallow counters but does not dispel unhallow. Material Components: Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the hallowed area."

If she follows, the hand points in your direction, leading her in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before her at a rate of anywhere up to 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject to you, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If she chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; she will have to rely on her own devices to locate you. If more than one subject within a five- mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within five miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears. The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and potential subjects. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading her back to you. The hand does not pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than five miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell."

Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures. Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does. Finally, if an evil creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blind- ness/deafness, but against holy aura’s save DC). Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint’s robe or a piece of parchment from a holy text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp."

Any potential threat (such as an armed party member moving behind the hypnotized creature) allows the creature a second saving throw. Any obvious threat, such as casting a spell, drawing a sword, or aiming an arrow, automatically breaks the hypnotism, as does shaking or slapping the creature. A hypnotized creature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action. While the subject is hypnotized, you can make a suggestion or request (provided you can communicate with it). The suggestion must be brief and reasonable. An affected creature reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. (The DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide has rules for creatures’ attitudes.) Even once the spell ends, it retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular suggestion. A creature who fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it."

Fire also drives insects away.

Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an “attack” includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8–8: Attack Roll Modifiers, page 132, for the effects of invisibility on combat. Arcane Material Components: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic."

You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you suffer a –6 Dexterity penalty as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a –8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can’t use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 points of lethal damage, and you are considered “armed” when making unarmed attacks (a Small caster deals 1d4 points of damage, not 1d6). Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone.

In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area. A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7- foot door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells."

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 x 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore next time). If you know only rumors, casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Examples of legend lore results: A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word ‘Rudnogg’ on the lips.” A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: “Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life. He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain.” (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns beneath the mountain.) A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: “The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods. Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day.” (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get the details you need to cast a better legend lore.) Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp. Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle."

The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest’s actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even wishes do not allow exceptions. The chests themselves are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be. To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it. Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally; and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive. Focus: The chest and its replica."

The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants). The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnishings—eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. Material Components: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) and the focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if these benefits are to be included."

An exterior temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it’s –20° outside, inside it’ll be 50°). The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it. The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

If you know an individual creature’s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task for you, and the creature may request some service in return. The more demanding your request, the greater return favor the creature asks for. This bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. If you agree to the service, the creature performs the task you requested, reports back to you afterward (if possible), and returns to its home plane. You are honor bound to perform the return favor. A creature may accept some form of payment, such as a magic item, in return for its service.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The type of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the spell. The target creature must attempt a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep the creature from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with a successful SR roll, dimensional travel, or a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster’s level + the caster’s Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see Calling, page 157) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature’s Charisma check. The DM then assigns a bonus based on the service and reward, from +0 to +6. This bonus applies to your Charisma check. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open- ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as “Wait here” or “Defend this area against attack”), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental."

For instance, “Attack any persons who come near without first saying ‘sacred mistletoe’” is an eleven-word trigger phrase that you could use at 11th level or higher. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. Statistics for a treant can be found in the Monster Manual.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body (leaving the receptacle empty). To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (on the same plane). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You, however, cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full- round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds at a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds at further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. For example, a fish’s body breathes water and a troll’s body regenerates. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (that is, it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host. Incorporeal creatures with the magic jar ability can use a handy, nearby object (not just a gem or crystal) as the magic jar. Focus: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp."

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated. For instance, if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: “Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within one foot.” Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, when anyone says “Boo”). Note that actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, “Speak when any creature touches the statue” is an acceptable command so long as the creature is visible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, HD, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers up to 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse. Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast only it on someone who is willing or restrained. Like bestow curse, mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse, however, works only if the caster is at least as high level as your mark of justice. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated."

At any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell’s duration runs out or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.

Stone shape deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18), in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, passwall expels you without damage."

The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks. Any creature in the straight-line path of these spheres is struck by each one and takes 24d6 points of fire damage (no save). If the spheres reach their destination, each bursts like a fireball in a spread. Each large sphere deals 6d6 points of fire damage. The four spheres explode with their points of origin forming a diamond or box pattern around the spell’s central point of origin, which you designate upon casting. Each large sphere has a 15-foot-radius spread, and each blast is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of the spell’s effect and exposing the center to all four blasts. The smaller spheres each have a 7 1/2- foot-radius spread, and each deals 3d6 points of fire damage. They explode with their points of origin forming a pattern around the spell’s central point of origin (which you designated upon casting) of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides measuring 20 feet long. The center has four areas of overlapping effect, and numerous peripheral areas have two or three overlapping areas of the spell’s effect. Creatures caught in a blast can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. Creatures struck by multiple blasts save against each blast separately."

Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity. Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it carries no experience point cost. Alternatively, the cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include: Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting until the end of the battle. Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error. Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s) nature is refused. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and SR as normal (but save DCs are for a 9th-level spell). When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component. XP Cost: 5,000 XP (for some uses of the miracle spell; see above)."

These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack roll against a figment destroys it. A figment’s AC is 10 + size modifier + Dexterity modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being struck by a fireball). While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts her eyes, the spell has no effect, though being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded: In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers’ attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on Search checks and most Strength- and Dexterity- based skill checks."

For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, etc. This spell does not affect other types of divination (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, etc.)."

You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed, can talk and gesture as if it were real, and even smells and feels real.

This spell cannot negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells. Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event she actually experienced. For instance, she could recall every word from a 5-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book. Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced. Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced. Casting the spell takes 1 action. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending up to 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell’s range during this time, the spell is lost. A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject’s actions, particularly if it contradicts her natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much she enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that she ever saw you or your party. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject."

An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor’s Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must succeed at a Will save (DC 25) or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities.

(Those already within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. It is stationary. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the watchdog, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. (For most defenders, the invisible creature gets a +2 attack bonus and the defender loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.) The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder’s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a +3 weapon for purposes of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the watchdog, the spell ends. Material Component: A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread."

It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round’s target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword’s AC against touch attacks is 13. If an attacked creature has SR, the resistance is checked the first time Mordenkainen’s sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled.

An attacking undead creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy. An attacking caster or weapon receives no damage.

    "description": "As Otiluke’s resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an Otiluke’s telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs up to 5,000 pounds. The range of the telekinetic control extends to a maximum distance of medium range from you (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents. You move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh up to a total of 5,000 pounds by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere the round after casting the spell. A round’s concentration (a standard action) moves the sphere up to 30 feet. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, the spell’s duration ends, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s duration. Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only one-sixteenth of the actual weight, so the orb can be rolled without exceptional effort. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere. You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it. Material Components: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets."

The mount cannot simply take off and fly. It can only ride horizontally across the air. After 1 round in the air, the mount falls. 14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed.

If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium-size or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. Gems of true seeing and similar magic reveal the presence of a phase door but do not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. A phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don’t qualify."

    "description": "As polymorph other, except this spell changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines: Increase to Changed Subject Is: Duration Factor* Same kingdom (animal, +5 vegetable, mineral) Same class (mammals, +2 fungi, metals, etc.) Same size +2 Related (twig is to tree, +2 wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) Same or lower Intelligence +2 *Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table.

If the original form didn’t have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores of the new form. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed. Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item’s or creature’s powers but does not add new powers except perhaps movement capabilities not present in the old form. A nonmagical object cannot be made magical by this spell. A magic item or weapon or other object can be polymorphed into another type of magic object, but it never gains abilities superior to those of the original object. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, and platinum. This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of polymorph other, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute water to dust, or transmute rock to mud. Arcane Material Components: Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."

The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject’s normal form, and can have no more hit dice than you have, or that the subject has, (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 hit dice. You cannot change a subject into a construct, elemental, outsider, or undead unless it is already that type. Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the creature further). If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. The polymorphed creature acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include natural armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effect, etc.), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, etc.). A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not magical flight and other magical forms of travel, such as blink, dimension door, phase door, plane shift, teleport, and teleport without error. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of magical ability, so they are not granted by this spell. Other nonmagical abilities (such as an owl’s low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form. The creature’s new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which it has been transformed. You cannot, for example, turn someone into a mighty weight lifter to give the subject great Strength. Likewise, you cannot change the subject into a bigger or more powerful version of a creature (or a smaller weaker version). Nor can you turn the subject into a varient form of the creature. For example, you can turn the subject into an ogre, but not a half-dragon ogre. The subject retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The subject retains its own type (for example, “humanoid”), extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities. The subject does not gain the supernatural abilities (such as breath weapons and gaze attacks) or the extraordinary abilities of the new creature. The subject can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components. The subject does not gain the spell-like abilities of its new form. When the polumorph occurs, the creature’s equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature who does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shamechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes non-functional. Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the subject’s equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties. The new form can be disorienting. Any time the polymorphed creature is in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or suffer a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes. Creatures who are polymorphed for a long time (years and years) grow accustomed to their new form and can overcome some of these drawbacks (DM’s discretion). You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form’s species. The subject can be changed into a member of its own species or even into itself. (If changed into itself, it does not suffer the abovementioned penalties from the disorientation of a new form.)

The effects are minor and have severe limitations. Prestidigitations can slowly lift 1 pound of material. They can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. They can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. They cannot inflict damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour. Characters typically use prestidigita- tions to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs."

However, any other creature with fewer than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded (see blindness/deafness) for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.

A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted. Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color. The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen’s disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispelling cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

    "description": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects: First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire’s supernatural domination ability, which works similar to dominate person). The protection does not prevent a vampire’s domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the protection from evil effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures (see the Monster Manual). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good elementals and outsiders are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature. Arcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3- foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

When an eye returns, it relays what it has seen to you and then disappears. Each eye is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. The spell conjures 1d4 eyes +1 eye per caster level. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct that has 1 hit point, has AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 skill modifier on Hide checks. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch. When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of up to twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might include: “Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures.” The phrase “Surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature whom you would regard as dangerous. A “peasant” that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn’t trigger an eye’s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and among themselves see everything that crosses the ring. “Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return.” The phrase “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. Other commands that might be useful include having the eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind everything it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye only 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. If an eye ever gets more than one mile distant from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if the eye is sent into darkness, then it’s very possible that it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect blinds creatures within 120 feet of the fire source for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers’ attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills. Smoke Cloud: The smoke is a writhing stream of smoke billowing out from the source and forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud suffer –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity scores (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the character leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply. Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level."

The spell also dispels fire spells in the area, though you must succeed at a dispel check of 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Fire-based creatures within the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level from the spell (maximum 15d6, no save allowed). Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame, such as a wand of fireball or a flame tongue sword.

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Affected creatures who fail their saves are captivated by the pattern. Captivated creatures cannot move away from the pattern, nor can they take actions other than to defend themselves. Thus, a captivated fighter cannot run away or attack but suffers no penalties when attacked. An attack on a captivated creature frees it from the spell immediately. With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All captivated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Captivated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), each captivated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can’t see them are no longer affected. The spell does not affect sightless creatures. Verbal Component: A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component. Material Component: A piece of phosphor.

In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 153). If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw. The subject loses a level (or 1 Constitution point, if she’s 1st level) when raised. Raise dead cures hit point damage up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level to an energy-draining creature. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.

A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but Strength decreases with size. For every 10% of reduction, a creature’s Strength score suffers an enlargement penalty of –1, to a minimum score of 1.

If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process requires 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated character recalls the majority of his former life and form. He retains his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any class abilities or skills he formerly possessed. His class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on his new body. First eliminate the character’s racial adjustments (since he is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below. The character’s level is reduced by 1. (If the character was 1st level, his new Constitution score is reduced by 1.) It’s quite possible for the change in the character’s ability scores to make it difficult for him to pursue his previous character class. If this happens, the character is well advised to become a multiclass character. The new incarnation is determined on the following table or by DM choice. d% Incarnation Str Dex Con 01–03 Badger +4 +8 +4 04–09 Bear, black +8 +2 +4 10–13 Bear, brown +15 +2 +8 14–17 Boar +4 0 +6 18–25 Centaur +8 +4 +4 26–28 Dryad 0 +4 0 29–32 Eagle 0 +4 +2 33–42 Elf 0 +2 –2 43–46 Gnome –2 0 +2 47–48 Hawk –4 +6 0 49–58 Halfling –2 +2 0 59–78 Human 0 0 0 79–80 Leopard +6 +8 +4 81–82 Owl –4 +6 0 83–86 Pixie –4 +8 0 87–90 Satyr 0 +2 +2 91–96 Wolf +2 +4 +4 97–99 Wolverine +10 +8 +8 100 Other ? ? ? (DM’s choice) Some bodies may make it impossible for the reincarnated character to use some of his class abilities. For example, a caster reincarnated as a hawk can’t cast spells with somatic components because he doesn’t have hands. The reincarnated character does gain any powers or abilities associated with his new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, etc. Refer to the Monster Manual for exact figures. A humanoid reincarnated into an animal body can speak the languages it formerly knew and is a magical beast. A wish spell can restore a reincarnated character to his original form."

Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects (barrels, siege towers, etc.) are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. (A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can unlimber it as a move-equivalent action.) If a spear is planted (set) to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects. The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell’s duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell’s power."

Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds up to eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope \"disappear.\" In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A force greater than that can pull the rope free. Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present in the Prime Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see it somehow can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Note: Creating an extradimensional space within or taking an extradimensional space into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.

Magical metal items are immune to this spell. You may employ rusting grasp in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Rusting grasp used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (up to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion. For example, full plate armor (AC +8) could be reduced to +7 or as low as +2 in protection, depending on the die roll. Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the weapon. (See Strike a Weapon, page 136.) A metal weapon that is hit is instantaneously destroyed. Note: Striking at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around. Against ferrous creatures, rusting grasp instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round."

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell’s area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."

The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read the text. (Original text resumes with The target is entitled). The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake’s strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days +1 day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. He is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of his surroundings. He can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides him with no protection against physical injury. However, if he is reduced to –1 to –9 hit points, he does not lose hit points or stabilize until the spell ends.

Thus, sequester can mask a secret door, a treasure vault, etc. The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices (such as a robe of eyes or a gem of seeing). Living creatures (and even undead creatures) affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.

Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength. All those that interact with the conjured object, force, or creature can make Will saves to recognize its shadowy nature. Those who succeed do so. Attack spells, such as flame arrow, have normal effects unless those affected succeed at Will saves. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Mimicked spells allow the normal saves and SR. Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mists, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are one-fifth strength or 20% likely to work. For instance, a shadow obscuring mist only provides one-half concealment at 25 feet, not 5 feet. Shadow creatures have one-fifth the normal hit points (regardless of whether they’re recognized as shadowy). They deal normal damage and have all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature who recognizes them as shadowy, however, such a creature’s damage is one- fifth normal, and all special abilities that do not produce normal damage (in hit points) are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature’s AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 total bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11). Those who succeed at their saves see the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms."

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you can move at a rate of up to seven miles every 10 minutes, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, a character can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. You know where you will come out on the Material Plane. Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful."

Your new form works like a polymorph other form. You still do not gain the supernatural or spell-like abilities of your new form, though you do gain its extraordinary abilities while keeping your own. You also gain the type of the new form (for example, “dragon” or “magical beast”) in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original forms. Thus, a new form’s poison bite is effective. You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. For example, you are in combat and assume the form of a will-o’-wisp. When this form is no longer useful, you change into a stone golem and walk away. When pursued, you change into a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off. From there, you can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything you are familiar with. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get +10 on your Disguise check.

    "description": "This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Search check for a rogue [only] to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. (Note that the head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared.) If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, causing no damage but tightly binding it. An entangled creature suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls and suffers a –4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the snare is anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, he can move at half speed, but can’t run or charge. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by this spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. The snare is magical. To escape, the trapped creature must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 23) or a Strength check (DC 23) that is a full-round action. The snare has 5 hit points and AC 7. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell."

    "description": "When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell’s area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot- square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM’s option). Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected. Creatures in mud must succeed at Reflex saves or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. Creatures who succeed at their saves can move through the mud at half speed, and they can’t run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area are reduced to half their normal speed and can’t run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings, or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed."

A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that the creature or object passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature’s alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive.

It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. It uses your base attack bonus as its attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds). It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round’s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. The spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or damaged. If an attacked creature has SR, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment.

If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn. 2nd Round: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. No save is allowed. 3rd Round: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. All may be directed at a single target, or they may be directed at up to six separate targets. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures struck can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. 4th Round: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save). 5th through 10th Rounds: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters. Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds at a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of vengeance’s save + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast."

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell’s power. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as –1, –2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM. Material Components: A snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil."

A swarm of poisonous creatures deals no damage to creatures who are immune to poison, though it still prevents spellcasting and concentration. The creatures’ attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction, being incorporeal, and other special abilities also make a creature immune to damage from the swarm. The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and damaging area effects can force it to disperse. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points of damage per caster level from these attacks. Certain area or effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately if appropriate to the swarm summoned. (For example, only fliers are affected by a gust of wind.) The swarm is stationary once summoned. A druid caster, however, can (as a move-equivalent action) direct the swarm to move up to 30 feet per round (or 90 feet per round if she has summoned bats or beetles).

    "description": "carefully engraved) Casting Time: 1 action or 10 minutes Range: 0 ft. Effect: One symbol Duration: See text Saving Throw: See text Spell Resistance: Yes This spell allows you to scribe any of the potent runes described below. A symbol can be quickly scribed in the air or on some surface. Alternatively, you can carefully inscribe it on a surface. The symbol harms those who trigger it (usually those who pass over it, touch it, read it, etc.) A quickly scribed symbol has a casting time of 1 action. The resulting rune becomes active immediately. It lasts 10 minutes per caster level and glows faintly while it lasts. Symbols of fear, hopelessness, pain, or persuasion can be used in this manner. Symbols of death, discord, insanity, pain, sleep, and stunning cannot. A carefully engraved symbol has a casting time of 10 minutes. The symbol is inactive when finished and remains so until triggered. Once triggered, it becomes active and glows, usually lasting 10 minutes per caster level. Some symbols can last indefinitely once triggered. For example, a symbol of death ends when it has slain 150 hit points worth of creatures. To be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective. As a default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: reads, touches, or passes over the rune, looks at the rune, or passes through a portal bearing the rune. In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To trigger a symbol, a creature must be within 60 feet of the rune. You can set special triggering conditions of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don’t qualify. For example, a symbol can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. A symbol’s triggering conditions must always be defensive in nature. A touch triggered symbol remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. Once the spell is cast, a symbol’s triggering conditions cannot be changed. You ignore the effects of your own symbols and cannot inadvertently trigger them. When scribing a symbol quickly, you can instantly attune any number of creatures to the symbol, rending them immune to its effects, provided the creatures are within 60 feet of the rune when it is created and that you are aware of their presence. When creating a carefully inscribed symbol, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (up to ten creatures) takes 1 hour. Attuning a large group (up to twenty -five creatures) takes one day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit. When triggered, a symbol affects all creatures within a 60 -foot radius except for you and any individuals attuned to it. If a symbol has a password, anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the character remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, he must use the password again. Once triggered, a symbol remains active until its duration expires. Creatures who subsequently meet an active symbol’s triggering conditions suffer its effects. A successful dispel magic removes the effects of a symbol from a creature unless the symbol’s effect is instantaneous (death, stunning) or the description specifies another remedy (insanity). The rune itself can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol. Destruction of the surface where a symbol rests destroys the symbol but also triggers its effects. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 19). Identifying the symbol does not discharge it and allows you to know the version of the symbol. Note: Magic traps such as symbol are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol. A symbol can be rendered permanent with the permanency spell, provided it is carefully engraved upon a permanent, nonportable surface such as a wall or door. A permanency spell extends a symbol’s basic duration of 10 minutes per caster level indefinitely. When triggered, a permanent symbol usually glows and is active for about 10 minutes, but there is no limit to how many times it can be triggered. If the symbol can affect only a limited number of hit points worth of creatures, the limit applies each 10 minutes. For example, a permanent symbol of death could slay 150 hit points worth of creatures every 10 minutes. Known symbols include: Death: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, must succeed at Fortitude saves or die. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures. Discord: All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who fail a Will save immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell. Fear: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. Creatures within the radius are afflicted by a powerful version of the fear spell. If scribed in the air, this symbol requires a Will save to resist. If the rune is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind- affecting spell. Hopelessness: All creatures within the radius must attempt Will saves. If the rune is carefully engraved on a surface, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4 x 10 minutes and submits to simple demands from foes, such as to surrender or get out. The effect is similar to that of the suggestion spell. If no foes are present to make demands, there is a 25% chance that a hopeless creature proves unable to take any action except hold its ground. If the creature remains free to act, there is a 25% chance it retreats from the rune at normal speed. In either case, the creature can defend normally if attacked. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind- affecting spell. Insanity: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, become insane (as the insanity spell; Will negates). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures. This version is a mind-affecting spell. Pain: Creatures within the radius suffer wracking pains that reduce Dexterity scores by 2 and impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (Fortitude negates). Both effects last 2d10 x 10 minutes. This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. If carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. Persuasion: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. All creatures within the radius must succeed at Will saves to resist. If the symbol is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature becomes the same alignment as you for 1d20 x 10 minutes. During this time, affected creatures become friendly to you as though subjected to charm person. This version is a mind-affecting spell. Sleep: Creatures within the radius fall into a catatonic slumber if they have 8 or fewer HD (Will negates). Sleeping creatures cannot be awakened for 3d6 x 10 minutes. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell. Stunning: One or more creatures within the radius whose total hit points do not exceed 250 become stunned (Fortitude negates). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. A stunned creature can’t act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it. In addition, the stunned creatures drop what they are holding. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Arcane Material Components (Quickly Scribed Symbol): A small amount of mercury and phosphorus. Material Components (Carefully Engraved Symbol): Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each."

The particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically—for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, vampires, etc. Larger groups, such as “goblinoids,” are not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named—for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or true neutral. Creatures of the type or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 25 pounds per caster level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with SR. This version of the spell lasts up to 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. You can hurl one or more objects or creatures who are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level. You must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder). Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)."

    "description": "This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is SR applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and SR. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can’t simply teleport to the warlord’s tent if you don’t know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what’s in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. Note: Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you’ve been there often or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps even from a precise map. “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist, such as if you have mistranslated an ancient tome and tried to teleport into a nonexistent treasure vault that you believe you read about, or if a traitorous guide has carefully described an enemy’s sanctum to you when that sanctum is completely different from what the traitor described. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target. That’s 18 miles, in this case. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, etc. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up somewhere else across the globe. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. TELEPORT Familiarity On Target Off Target Similar Area Mishap Very familiar 01–97 98–99 100 — Studied carefully 01–94 95–97 98–99 100 Seen casually 01–88 89–94 95–98 99–100 Viewed once 01–76 77–88 89–96 97–100 Description 01–52 53–76 77–92 93–100 False destination (1d20+80) — — 81–92 93–100"

    "description": "This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink until hip- or chest-deep, reducing their speed to 5 feet and giving them –2 penalties on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud. Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed at Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effects of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. Arcane Material Component: Clay and water."

    "description": "Trap the soul forces a creature’s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways. Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows SR (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature’s name is spoken as well, any SR is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or SR is successful, the gem shatters. Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of SR or a save. Material Component: Before the actual casting of trap the soul, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 HD creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Focus (Trigger Object Only): If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed."

In a thick oak forest, this means that a 10th-level druid could make ten transports over the course of 10 rounds, traveling up to 30,000 feet (about six miles) by doing so. Each transport is a full-round action. You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, though you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete."

The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus her vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimen- sional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not cancel concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance. Additionally, the divine version of this spell allows the subject to see auras, noting alignments of creatures at a glance.

Second, all turning checks to turn undead suffer a –4 profane penalty and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (Note: This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.) Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire consecrated site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, negative energy protection, protection from elements, remove fear, resist elements, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one unhallow (and its associated spell effect) at a time.

It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, and that is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. Its speed is 15 feet.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Fire, including fireball and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice. It deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage suffered by objects). Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level. Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th- level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. It is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach. You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures can avoid being trapped by the hemisphere by making successful Reflex saves.

If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 40) to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.

The wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5- foot square per level. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create a span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by disintegrate or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but the wall is so hard that the first 8 points of damage from each blow are ignored. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

    "description": "The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle- sharp thorns as long as a person’s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through the wall of thorns takes 25 points of damage per round of movement, minus 1 point for each point of the creature’s AC. Dexterity bonuses to AC and dodge bonuses do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher take no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10- by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to caster level x 2. This has no effect on the damage inflicted by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier. Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall. To make any progress, a creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 20). A successful creature moves a number of feet equal to its Strength check result minus 19, so a creature who rolled 24 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at their normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be carefully breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns away the barrier in 10 minutes."

    "description": "Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points—floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.—or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers. An entangled creature suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a –4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can’t move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell. Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the webs and is free to act, though moving may be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding at a Strength check (DC 20) or an Escape Artist check (DC 25). Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. The web provides one-quarter cover for every 5 feet of the substance between you and an opponent—one-half cover for 10 feet of web, three-quarters for 15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more. (See Table 8–9: Cover, page 133.) The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire—a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, etc.—can set them alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames. Material Component: A bit of spider web."

Directing the cyclone’s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The whirlwind always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds—possibly endangering you or your allies—and then dissipates. (You can’t regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the whirlwind must succeed at a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. Medium-size or smaller creatures that fail their first save must succeed at a second one or be picked up bodily by the whirlwind and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed.

The whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as one mile per hour or as quickly as one mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered.

A magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) or as slow as 5 feet per round (1/2 mph), as the walker wills. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. A wind walker can regain her physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form requires 5 rounds. You, however, may dismiss the spell, ending it immediately. You may even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. While in vaporous form, subjects gain damage reduction 20/+1, though they may sustain damage from high winds (as determined by the DM). No spellcasting is possible in vaporous form. For the last minute of the spell, a wind walker automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though she may descend faster if she wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end."

Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall suffers a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, which is sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

    "description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can do any one of the following: Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s from a prohibited school. Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it’s from a prohibited school. Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. Create a valuable item, even a magic item, of up to 15,000 gp in value. Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects must be cured of the same type of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage your party has suffered, or remove all the poison effects from the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead. Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the feat takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place these creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate and SR. Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, the wish could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate and SR. You may wish for greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives you the opportunity to fulfill your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.) For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff’s current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as in imprisonment), where you could “live” indefinitely. Duplicated spells allow saves and SR as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component. XP Cost: 5,000 XP or more (see above)."
